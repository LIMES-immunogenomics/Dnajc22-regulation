# Dnajc22-regulation

For the present study we used R package version 3.3.0 of org.Mm.eg.db and 2.0.19 of kohonen. For the sake of reproducibility, we encourage the users of the pipeline to use the same packages. However, the newer versions of these packages are also compatible with the provided pipeline and can be used as well.
